Prior to transitioning into the field of technical writing, my career began in languages, in teaching and translation roles. I worked as a tutor in French as a foreign language at the University of Aberdeen, followed by a position as a French teacher in professional settings.

Motivated by my interest in technical subjects, I explored technical translation as a potential career path, aiming to establish myself in the field. While this venture encountered obstacles, it ultimately spurred my transition into technical writing. Acknowledging the necessity for additional skill refinement, I pursued formal training in technical writing.

My professional journey as a technical writer began in the machinery industry, where I spent six years not only as a technical writer but also as a documentation manager. Seeking new challenges and growth opportunities, I made the strategic decision to transition into the field of informatics. In this role, I primarily focused on technical writing and project management, with occasional involvement in UX design and Scrum Master tasks.
