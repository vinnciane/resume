When I'm not working, you'll find me often roaming about the mountains, or exploring different parts of the world, even though the pandemic and environmental concerns had me slow down a bit.

I also engage in different creative ventures, such as painting and music (voice).

I find gardening a truly relaxing occupation. I grow my own vegetables in my tiny garden and take care of my beloved flowers.
